# cryptofolio
Simple web based crypto portfolio manager &amp; start/stop mining rigs based on solar array output 

This web application has 2 purposes:

1. It allows you to have a web page to manage your crypto portfolio. I've tried a number of them over the years, yet could never find
a simple one that listed all the coins I have, like some very low marketcap ones. This webapp uses coingecko's site and API to build
your portfolio.

2. If you are a miner and have:
a. a solar array with a way to pull the watt output at every given moment 
b. remote power plugs (zwave, wifi plugs etc.)

You can adjust my script to get your rigs to start and stop automatically based on the solar output your array is generating. No more
huge electricity bill!
